# Docs

Start here if you want to extend the game (new buildings, troops, or systems).

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: codebase map + data flow (React ⇄ Phaser).
- `docs/RENDERING_AND_DEPTH.md`: isometric coordinates + depth rules + ground-plane baking.
- `docs/ADDING_BUILDINGS.md`: step-by-step for new buildings (stats, rendering, UI, backend).
- `docs/ADDING_TROOPS.md`: step-by-step for new troops (stats, rendering, UI, behavior).
